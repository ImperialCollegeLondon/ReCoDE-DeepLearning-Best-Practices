# Additional Best Practices

<details>
<summary><b>Use Miniconda</b></summary>

It's usually unnecessary to install full anaconda environment, miniconda should be enough (weights around 80MB).

Big advantage of conda is that it allows for installing packages without requiring certain compilers or libraries to be available in the system (since it installs precompiled binaries), so it often makes it easier to install some dependencies e.g. cudatoolkit for GPU support.

It also allows you to access your environments globally which might be more convenient than creating new local environment for every project.

Example installation:

```bash
wget https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh
bash Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh
```

Update conda:

```bash
conda update -n base -c defaults conda
```

Create new conda environment:

```bash
conda create -n myenv python=3.10
conda activate myenv
```

<summary><b>Use automatic code formatting</b></summary>

Use pre-commit hooks to standardize code formatting of your project and save mental energy.<br>
Simply install pre-commit package with:

```bash
pip install pre-commit
```

Next, install hooks from [.pre-commit-config.yaml](.pre-commit-config.yaml):

```bash
pre-commit install
```

After that your code will be automatically reformatted on every new commit.

To reformat all files in the project use command:

```bash
pre-commit run -a
```

To update hook versions in [.pre-commit-config.yaml](.pre-commit-config.yaml) use:

```bash
pre-commit autoupdate
```

<summary><b>Set private environment variables in .env file</b></summary>

System specific variables (e.g. absolute paths to datasets) should not be under version control or it will result in conflict between different users. Your private keys also shouldn't be versioned since you don't want them to be leaked.<br>

Template contains `.env.example` file, which serves as an example. Create a new file called `.env` (this name is excluded from version control in .gitignore).
You should use it for storing environment variables like this:

```
MY_VAR=/home/user/my_system_path
```

All variables from `.env` are loaded in `train.py` automatically.

Hydra allows you to reference any env variable in `.yaml` configs like this:

```yaml
path_to_data: ${oc.env:MY_VAR}
```

<details>
<summary><b>Name metrics using '/' character</b></summary>

Depending on which logger you're using, it's often useful to define metric name with `/` character:

```python
self.log("train/loss", loss)
```

This way loggers will treat your metrics as belonging to different sections, which helps to get them organised in UI.

<details>
<summary><b>Use torchmetrics</b></summary>

Use official [torchmetrics](https://github.com/PytorchLightning/metrics) library to ensure proper calculation of metrics. This is especially important for multi-GPU training!

For example, instead of calculating accuracy by yourself, you should use the provided `Accuracy` class like this:

```python
from torchmetrics.classification.accuracy import Accuracy


class LitModel(LightningModule):
    def __init__(self)
        self.train_acc = Accuracy()
        self.val_acc = Accuracy()

    def training_step(self, batch, batch_idx):
        ...
        acc = self.train_acc(predictions, targets)
        self.log("train/acc", acc)
        ...

    def validation_step(self, batch, batch_idx):
        ...
        acc = self.val_acc(predictions, targets)
        self.log("val/acc", acc)
        ...
```

Make sure to use different metric instance for each step to ensure proper value reduction over all GPU processes.

Torchmetrics provides metrics for most use cases, like F1 score or confusion matrix. Read [documentation](https://torchmetrics.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#more-reading) for more.

<summary><b>Follow PyTorch Lightning style guide</b></summary>

The style guide is available [here](https://pytorch-lightning.readthedocs.io/en/latest/starter/style_guide.html).<br>

1. Be explicit in your init. Try to define all the relevant defaults so that the user doesnâ€™t have to guess. Provide type hints. This way your module is reusable across projects!

   ```python
   class LitModel(LightningModule):
       def __init__(self, layer_size: int = 256, lr: float = 0.001):
   ```

2. Preserve the recommended method order.

   ```python
   class LitModel(LightningModule):

       def __init__():
           ...

       def forward():
           ...

       def training_step():
           ...

       def training_step_end():
           ...

       def on_train_epoch_end():
           ...

       def validation_step():
           ...

       def validation_step_end():
           ...

       def on_validation_epoch_end():
           ...

       def test_step():
           ...

       def test_step_end():
           ...

       def on_test_epoch_end():
           ...

       def configure_optimizers():
           ...

       def any_extra_hook():
           ...
   ```

<details>
<summary><b>Version control your data and models with DVC</b></summary>

Use [DVC](https://dvc.org) to version control big files, like your data or trained ML models.<br>
To initialize the dvc repository:

```bash
dvc init
```

To start tracking a file or directory, use `dvc add`:

```bash
dvc add data/MNIST
```

DVC stores information about the added file (or a directory) in a special .dvc file named data/MNIST.dvc, a small text file with a human-readable format. This file can be easily versioned like source code with Git, as a placeholder for the original data:

```bash
git add data/MNIST.dvc data/.gitignore
git commit -m "Add raw data"
```

<details>
<summary><b>Support installing project as a package</b></summary>

It allows other people to easily use your modules in their own projects.
Change name of the `src` folder to your project name and complete the `setup.py` file.

Now your project can be installed from local files:

```bash
pip install -e .
```

Or directly from git repository:

```bash
pip install git+git://github.com/YourGithubName/your-repo-name.git --upgrade
```

So any file can be easily imported into any other file like so:

```python
from project_name.models.mnist_module import MNISTLitModule
from project_name.data.mnist_datamodule import MNISTDataModule
```

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Keep local configs out of code versioning</b></summary>

Some configurations are user/machine/installation specific (e.g. configuration of local cluster, or harddrive paths on a specific machine). For such scenarios, a file [configs/local/default.yaml](configs/local/) can be created which is automatically loaded but not tracked by Git.

For example, you can use it for a SLURM cluster config:

```yaml
# @package _global_

defaults:
  - override /hydra/launcher@_here_: submitit_slurm

data_dir: /mnt/scratch/data/

hydra:
  launcher:
    timeout_min: 1440
    gpus_per_task: 1
    gres: gpu:1
  job:
    env_set:
      MY_VAR: /home/user/my/system/path
      MY_KEY: asdgjhawi8y23ihsghsueity23ihwd
```
