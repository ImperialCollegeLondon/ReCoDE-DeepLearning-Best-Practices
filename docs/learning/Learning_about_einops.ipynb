    "# Einops (Einstein Operations) Tutorial\n",
    "\n",
    "Einops (short for Einstein Operations) is a powerful Python library that provides a more readable and expressive way to manipulate tensors in deep learning and scientific computing. It's compatible with various tensor libraries like NumPy, PyTorch, and TensorFlow. In this tutorial, we'll explore how to use Einops for tensor operations.\n",

    "## 1. Introduction to Einops\n",
    "\n",
    "Einops offers a more flexible and intuitive approach to tensor operations, such as reshaping, transposing, and repeating, by using a readable and concise syntax. It simplifies complex operations and makes your code more maintainable.\n",
